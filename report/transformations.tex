\subsection{Array Expansion}
To move the outer loop into the timeline loop on listing \ref{timeloop}, a number of array expansions is required.

\subsection{Nest interchange and loop distribution}

\subsubsection{Structural}
\paragraph{Interchanging the outer loop inwards}
\subparagraph{Motivation} In the original structure of the program, we have that a whole slew of loops
 (all of the loops in section \ref{sec:third}) are nested
 within the sequential time iterating loop (listing \ref{timeloop}) which itself is positioned within
 the outer loop (listing \ref{outerloop}). Meaning that we in general had 4-tiered loop nests of the following difficult to parallise
 structure.
$$\mathrm{parallel} \to \mathrm{sequential} \to \mathrm{parallel} \to \mathrm{parallel}$$

\subparagraph{Action} Performed a nest interchange on the outer and time loops.

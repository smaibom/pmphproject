\section{Performance}
We have included the following two versions of our program:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \verb!/Cuda/! directory contains our finished program which fully runs on CUDA.
\item The \verb!/OrigImpl/! directory contains our fully transformed CPU implementation which runs with OpenMP.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Runtime}

\subsection{Validation} All the included versions of the program validate against the original test.
